# Artisan Task Definition List

## Team Standardization
- Standard Team Norming protocols absolutely need to be set. Core hours, ceremonies, pairing rotatations, team roles, product owner, etc.
- **Artisans** will contribute to determining and setting these norms.

## Project Forecasting
- Make an informed guess at how the expedition project may go. Draft plans for the expedition and declare possible deliverables. This should include determining which Artisans tasks will need to be completed and establishing a rough timeline of when the client can expect them. 
- **Artisans** will be contribute to these discussions, driving which Artisan tasks (and perhaps how) should be completed. 

## Experience Task Iteration
- Collaboration with Experience; This may include helping create an ‘Interview Protocol’ for user interviews, helping ideate and create in Design Thinking sessions, and other Experience led activities. 
- **Artisans** should iterate through Experience activities and influence the outputs of the Experience tasks by offering opinions and observations. Artisans should work with Experience team members to produce artifacts from each task. 

## Business Object Modeling
- This is an activity that creates a common language/understanding around which the various people in the Expedition Project can engage with each other and the solution. This should represent the business needs and be technology/solution agnostic. I.E. Each credit card is associated with one account and can be in one wallet, but each account could have many cards associated with it and a wallet can carry many cards.
- **Artisans** will generate a model that reflect the business needs/uses and how they relate to one another. This should be collaborated on or reviewed with Experience and Business stakeholders and should reflect reality. 

## Journey Map Creation
- A map detailing the journey of the user(s). This will typically include interviewing and/or observing users to understand how they currently interact with a product or process. 
- **Artisans** will help develop the various user journeys, ensuring the underlying technology being used is reflected and understood by Artisans as well as Experience. 

## Journey Map Analysis
- Understand how current steps happen and identify potential efficiencies and their solutions. This might include applying existing client ideas or technologies to the map, as well as coming up with a new approach or idea.
- **Artisans** will iterate on the journey map artifact to incorporate their analyses, resulting in derivative artifacts (i.e., Tech Journey Map). Artisans should work to identify possible gaps in the existing journey map solutions and propose ways to bridge them. This will lead to Featuring.

## Featuring
- Converting potential solutions into a list of features that fall into one of the following categories: Needs, Wants, or Nice to Haves. This would be taking a concept like a  “Calendar” and converting it to a list of features that can be sorted into these categories. This should be implementation agnostic.
- **Artisans** will work with Experience to formalize ideas for features and decide their priority. Artifacts will be created detailing these features and their importance, and will be used in experience sessions. 

## Understanding Current Ecosystem
- Understand the existing technology; what is leveraged most and what is overlooked. What information exists and how it is consumed. Is the client a haskell shop running serverless or are they java microservices etc? 
- **Artisans** will discover the current ecosystem and can create artifacts documenting the current ecosystem so that they can make confident recommendations later in the expedition.

## Exploring Current Ecosystem Possibilities
- Explore what can be done using the existing technology ecosystem differently to envision a new solution. What tech could be leveraged more? What are the boundaries of the existing ecosystem, and what are the costs (Political, financial, other) of walking away. 
- **Artisans** will explore the boundaries of the current ecosystem and may create artifacts about their discoveries.

## Existing Solution Discovery
- Finding existing products in the Market that are in the same space as the problems or solutions you are exploring. Competitor or similar product comparison. Should be relatively high level.
- **Artisans** will work with Experience to find the existing products in the Market and perform high level evaluations from both a tech and user experience perspective. 

## Existing Solution Analysis
- Vetting existing solutions against the proposed feature set, ensuring it meets the usability desired from Experience and contains the needed features. Why rebuild something that already exists. 
- **Artisans** will examine solutions exposed in solution discovery and will document their research and recommendations. They will also discuss usability concerns with the Experience team and document whether the usability concerns will impact adoption.

## Proof of Concepts
- Building small pieces of tech to demonstrate the possibilities of what can or cannot be done and how it can be accomplished. This could be anything from a mock to a fully functioning prototype.
- **Artisans** will confer with Experience to find and advocate for the correct level of definition. If it is determined that software is needed, artisans will build and demo the proof.

## Product Roadmapping
- Proposed order of feature implementation to maximize adoption and functionality of the proposed products or solutions. 
- **Artisans** will contribute to the product roadmap artifact by giving recommendations about the optimal product timeline. The output will include proposals for transitioning the expedition project to a solution project

## Strategy Hypotheses Deliverable(s)
- This is the ‘handoff’ item(s) that contains the potential directions in regards to software, information architecture, business processes, etc. Any information you want to hand over to the client/implementation team. This could be in the form of a slide deck, word doc, mark down, prototype, mocks, etc.
- **Artisans** will work with Experience to prepare these deliverables and include artifacts that they have worked on over the course of the project. All technical work will be handed off, and recommendations, and the reasons behind them, are made clear to the client.
