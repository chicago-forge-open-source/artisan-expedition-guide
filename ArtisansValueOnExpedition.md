# Why Artisans are Valuable to have on an Expedition

Artisans bring a unique and valuable perspective to the fuzzy front end of innovation. By observing users through research, team members gain a natural understanding of the insights and through this becomes an advocate for the user throughout the entire build & iterate process. The empathy that they built for users will show as they craft solutions that do not cut corners at the expense of the experience, but instead push the limits because they see the value that the user will. 

They will feel empowered by the product definition because they have been involved since its inception, instead of feeling constrained by a list of requirements that were handed over the wall. 

Artisans in the research phase of the project will bring new perspectives to the data. They will ask questions that DX/XAs may not have thought to ask. They will understand context of users in a technical environment that a non-technical researchers may miss. 
 
Artisans will support looking for themes in qualitative data during synthesis.
