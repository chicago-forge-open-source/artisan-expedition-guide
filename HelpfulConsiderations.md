### Intro to Consulting by Mary Kaufmann
Much of what consultants do is about working side by side with other people, teams, leaders, etc. to guide them into new ways of thinking and behaving. The ultimate goal is to help them produce value into their industry and marketplace. To guide others we must become great consultants.

#### What does it mean to consult?
It doesn't mean that we are experts and we certainly don't want come across with arrogance or that we have the be the smartest person in the room. This posture actually repels people away from us and that is not going to help us.

Ask yourself, "What does it take for someone to influence you to take some action or make some change in your life?" This is consulting. We asked a lot of people this question and their number one answer was "empathy." People needed to know that the person giving them advice actually cared about them and was empathetic to their cause.

As consultants, we should be creating value (delivering something), learning and teaching others.

#### So, what can you do?
- Learn from others
- Be an influencer (Think about times when you have listened to someone else’s advice and then you changed your opinion. What about their ability to influence you caused you to take action? You can learn from this and apply it in your approach with others.)
- Be a continuous learner
- Teach others

Delivery team members tend to be closely familiar with the Big Inhibitors as they relate to each project, therefore they are an excellent resource for discussing potential frictions.
