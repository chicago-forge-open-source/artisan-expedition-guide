# Overview

The Artisan Expedition Guide is a document intended to give Software Artisans an overview of what they are responsible for and what they can expect on an Expedition. It expounds upon why Artisans need to be involved because an Expedition may come off as a primarily Experience process, and Artisans may question their place in the process. The guide also lays out the fundamental tasks that an Artisan may do over the course of an Expedition and the time period these tasks may be started and finished. In addition to explaining what Artisans do, the document explains what Artisans can expect Experience and Delivery to do during an Expedition and how it relates back to Artisans. The guide offers helpful considerations that will make the process easier on for Artisans, their team, the client, and the project as a whole. Finally, the Artisan Expedition Guide will give some guidelines to what success may look and feel like, and what a successful Expedition may produce.
