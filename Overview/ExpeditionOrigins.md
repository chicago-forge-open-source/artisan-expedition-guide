The expedition concept was prompted by the question - "How should the engagement with Seawolf continue?" "How do we responsibly engage with the projects spinning out of OoT without being able to execute them ourselves.'' â€œHow are we describing the work we're currently doing for OoT?"

In this process, we came to describe the platonic "OoT" like project as an Expedition.

By this, we meant to illustrate that the Expedition project was a "discovery" that instead of clarifying one project idea would be expected to yield or justify many project ideas. The distinction being that an Expedition would only carry a project idea far forward enough that it could be picked up by another team... essentially being an idea generator that would try to find solution ideas, and then after they're justified, hit the gas on them and hand them over to an Execution project team.

This is to say, an Expedition is not expected to do anything but the minimum viable production in order to determine investment viability. And investment viability can be measured in many forms (estimated ROI, estimated user impact, etc), as long as they provide the client with the ability to make an informed choice.

Using these definitions, we can more clearly describe the following situations:
- Product X.0 Expedition, and has multiple Execution teams picking up work from the Expedition
- Product X.0 Expedition, some Execution teams, and some Execution fulfilled by other parties.
- Product X.0 Expedition, only Execution fulfilled by other parties

Knowing all of these situations need to be supported responsibly, we can make clear recommendations on the size and shape that Product X.0 would recommend to make each of these arrangements succeed.
