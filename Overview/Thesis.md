# Thesis

Product X.0 has the capability to build and iterate on a defined solution concept. Product X.0 also has the capability to build and iterate on a weakly defined solution that needs additional clarification - we start those projects off with a discovery.

However, sometimes there may be a whole field of potential solutions to be explored - some clients have deep problems, but don't yet have handle on what solutions should be attempted, or their solutions are so speculative that they're not ready to commit to building them.

For these clients, Product X.0 is ready to perform an Expedition. The Expedition project will explore the problem space, learn about the users, business and domain, and clarify solutions to the point where they can be executed.
