#+ When to Prototype

To understand when to prototype, artisans must first understand that the goal of a prototype is to answer a specific question about a product concept. Two outputs of achieving the goal are demonstrating proposed optimal user experience, and discovering and avoiding technology-specific icebergs.

A prototype does not come without its costs. Therefore, when deciding whether to prototype one must consider the level of artisan involvement and how much value artisans will provide. To do this, some helpful questions need to be answered to higher powers that be such as gods and middle management. 

The main question for deciding is what is the depth of implementation required for the prototype. Implementations like screen mocks and wireframes are mostly led by Experience and still require Artisan input. Rich content that may require code will be a full team endeavor that is led by Artisans. To decide whether or not to invest in a Rich Content Prototype (RCP) it’s important to consider the following questions:
- How much of the team will need to be involved? How much of each discipline?
- Does a RCP better evaluate investment viability (estimated ROI, estimated user impact, etc)?
- Does a RCP start the conversation we want with the client?
- Will an RCP get the most useful feedback from the users/client?
- Will an RCP get feedback that can not be solicited by other means?
- Will the RCP stop the delivery of other necessary tasks of the Expedition?
- Does prototyping a technology offer a clearer answer to the Goal question?
- Do we have enough information to make a valuable RCP?
- Do we have concrete features and user experiences we’re trying to prototype?
 
In addition to the depth of implementation, Artisans must take into account financial costs associated with prototyping. It is important that Artisans work with Delivery to monitor financial burn down.
 
Finally, Artisans should understand what they are responsible for when they decide to prototype. Artisans and Delivery need make sure the client and team have a shared expectations of what the prototype will output. Having a good understanding of the current atmosphere or ecosystem will aid in the setting of shared expectations. If expectations are not framed correctly, clients could be expecting something that is production-ready and/or the final product. Lastly, artisans should know the appropriate time to stop prototyping. Artisans should stop prototyping if financial constraints are met and the client asks you to stop.
