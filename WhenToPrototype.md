## When to Prototype

To understand when to prototype, artisans must first understand that the goal of a prototype is to answer a specific question about a product concept. Two outputs of achieving the goal are demonstrating proposed optimal user experience, and discovering and avoiding technology-specific icebergs.



- Questions to ask to decide when Artisans should prototype
    - Artisan-Led Prototype = ALP (full team needed)
    - Experience-Led Prototype = ELP (Artisans advising on)
    - What is the depth of implementation required for the prototype?
        - Light: Screen mocks -> ELP
        - Middle: Wireframes -> ELP
        - Rich: Full-blown code -> ALP
    - Does an ALP better evaluate investment viability (estimated ROI, estimated user impact, etc)?
    - Does an ALP start the conversation we want with the client?
    - Will an ALP get the most useful feedback from the users/client?
    - Will an ALP get feedback that can not be solicited by other means?
    - Will the ALP stop the delivery of other necessary tasks of the Expedition?
    - Does prototyping a technology offer a clearer answer to the Goal question?
    - Do we have enough information to make a valuable ALP?
    - Do we have concrete features and user experiences weâ€™re trying to prototype?
- Concerns when deciding to prototyping
    - Financial cost to prototype
    - Understanding that prototyping too early on a concept or journey can be explosive and/or create an output of little usable feedback
        - Explosive: client can be mad about how the prototype comes out; may be expecting something else e.g. a final product
        - Unintended: Client could try and use code not meant to be in production for production
- Responsibilities taken on when agreeing to prototype
    - Artisans are responsible for the following:
        - Client and team have a shared expectations of what the prototype will output
        - Good understanding of the current atmosphere or ecosystem
        - Knowing the appropriate time to stop prototyping
            - Financial constraints met
            - The client asks you to stop
